# Daniel Quest
"Daniel Quest" is a long-run puzzle game created in Javascript and HTML.

Github release be found [here]([https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/minekhan/5647155001376768](https://low-fat-lard.github.io/daniel-quest/)).

This is the most up-to-date version, and I frequently code in production on this version. Beware of bugs.


To build the project, first clone/download it, then `cd` into the directory, then `npm install`, then `npm run build`. This will build the project into the `dist` folder. From there, you can either `node index.js` to start a server on localhost:4000, or just open the html file.

The main storage system uses `localStorage` instead of using a database so it is very buggy. be aware.
